# FAC Application 
FAC Spring 2021 application website 

I have built this one-page responsive website as part of my application for Founders & Coders Bootcamp using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 

I hope you enjoy my website as much as i did making it.

If I had more time I would have done the following:
    Customise styling on radio buttons questions
    Create a custom alert dialogue for my radio buttons
    Add an antique frame around my carousel  
                        
Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the FAC team, in particular Oli and Gregor for their workshops on JavaScript, DOM manipulation and carousel. 
I would like to thank fellow applicants for their support over our weekly zoom sessions.
I would like to thank my family for their support, in particular Shehra and David.

Thank you.
