# FAC Application 
FAC Spring 2021 application website 

I have built this one-page responsive website as part of my application for Founders & Coders Bootcamp using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 

I hope you enjoy my website as much as i did making it.

If I had more time I would have done the following:
                        <li> Customised styling on radio buttons questions</li>
                        <li> Created a custom alert dialogue for my radio buttons</li>
                        <li> Added an antique frame around my carousel</li>
                        <li> Refine my cards in the FAC section (styling and fix blur and highlight bugs)</li>
                        <li> Standardise the margin and padding across the site</li>
                        <li> Refine the mobile layout for the FAC section</li>


Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the FAC team, in particular Oli and Gregor for their workshops on JavaScript, DOM manipulation and carousel. 
I would like to thank fellow applicants for their support over our weekly zoom sessions.

Thank you.
