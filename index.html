                </div>
                <div class="about-content1 txt">
                    <p>Hello. I’m Safia. I was born in London to working class immigrant Pakistani parents, the sixth of ten children. Growing up I knew the importance of education and at a very young age was obsessed with learning, be it through books, films or people. My interests varied from sciences, mathematics, photography, languages and technology. Although I excelled at school I never imagined I would pursue further education as it wasn’t something the women in my family had done nor was it something that was encouraged.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="about-content2 txt"> 
                    <p>As a teenager I became interested in optometry as I had been short-sighted since I was seven and so the subject of eyes fascinated me. However I was equally interested in languages, learning to speak Urdu, Punjabi and Spanish. I also developed a passion for IT. So, when I got the opportunity to go to university, I felt optometry would be a profession which would provide a stable and secure future.</p>

                <div class="about-content3 txt"> 
                    <p>I have now been practising as an Optometrist for over a decade and over the past few years there were aspects of the job that no longer resonated with me. Although I still remained passionate about helping people and solving problems, I felt there was something missing. So in the late spring of 2020, with COVID lockdown in full swing I found myself out of work for the first time since I was 18 years old. I took that time to reflect, and explore my creative side, which included learning to paint, riding a bike and baking madeleines. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="about-content4 txt"> 
                    <p>Over the years I had explored other possible career paths but I hadn’t gotten anywhere conclusive. So I decided to get help and I signed to up to a careershifters-coaching course. During this eight-week course I found that I wanted to work in an industry where I could be creative and express myself, where I was continually learning and growing and was able to make a genuine difference in peoples lives.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="about-content5 txt"> 
                    <p>While researching industries that interested me I came across the freeCodeCamp website and when I started learning HTML and CSS it felt like I was learning a new language. I fell in love with it. The more I learnt the more it felt right.This has culminated in me being able to produce this website exercising the skills I've learnt on this journey. I look forward to where it leads me next. </p>

                    <p>During the first lockdown in 2020, i started to paint. And by paint, i mean fancy colouring in, with paint. I absolutely fell in love with it! This is one of the paintings i completed in November 2020. The best combo is painting whilst listening to podcasts.A recent faviorite of mine is the FAC podcast on sound cloud, Azizi is a great presenter, the time just flew by. </p>

                <div class="fac-answer">
                    <p>When I was researching on how to re-train to become a full stack web developer, I found that the most popular route was bootcamps. There were many available but when I came across Founders and Coders I knew straight away that this was where I wanted to learn.</p>
                    <p>There are so many factors that make your boot camp the best learning environment for me. Your policy on inclusion and diversity, collaboration and peer-lead learning are exceptional. The guide to allyship initiative that you expect your cohort members to follow shows me that you take it very seriously. I have faced much discrimination in my life due to my gender, ethnicity and religion. The knowledge that you offer a safe space for learning was greatly reassuring.</p>
                    <p>One of the other main reasons why I am drawn to this particular bootcamp is the requirement to be a mentor for the next cohort. I find the chance to give back and help others in their journey to be extremely rewarding. When I attended the weekly Monday and Wednesday workshops, I saw this in practice, as the coaches were kind, respectful and so helpful. Moreover, I have also thoroughly enjoyed the weekly peer-programming zoom sessions with fellow applicants as they helped make the learning process less daunting.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, another reason for my interest in your bootcamp is your collaboration with Tech for Better, an excellent enterprise that gives charities and entrepreneurs the resources to develop apps that are usually only accessible to large cooperation’s. Thus having a lasting on impact on social change and the local community.</p>
                    <p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Founders and Coders team and Slack community for all the support I have received on my journey so far in becoming a developer. Over the past few months I have met some inspiring individuals who have given me a good insight into what it would be like to be part of your bootcamp. I hope I am successful in this endeavour.</p>

                                    modules but found the JavaScript modules difficult to initially grasp the abstract concepts. My top tips for learning with FCC are to download a code editor, like 
                                    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a> or work with an online code editor like <a href="https://repl.it/languages/html">repl.it</a> 
                                    or <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> and practice the code syntax as you learn it. That way you will make associations and learn quicker.

Normal blink rate is about 15x a minute, this reduces to 5-7x when on digital devices. So by blinking you stop the surface of the eye from drying out. </p>
